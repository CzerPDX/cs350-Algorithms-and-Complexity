HW4 Writeup 
CS 415 - Parallel Programming

The first part of this assignment (bsort-file.c) asked us to write a program that opened a file,
gave the contents of it to the bucket_sort routine, and then saved the sorted array back out to
a file using fread and fwrite. This was interesting to me because I'd never used these particular
routines before, and I notice they are very similar in structure to the MPI read/write routines
that we've been workign with in the past few labs.

The most difficult part of this lab was keeping track of everything. With so many arrays and transfers
happening implicitly through parallelism, I ended up making two mistakes that cost me hours. In both
cases I simply used the wrong variable. In one case I used the wrong array name, and in another I used
the wrong index variable. It was easier to make this mistake than I would have guessed at the start,
even with some experience using MPI. However, it's hard to track down simple issues sometimes
without being able to rely on a debugger. 

Instead of being able to see exactly where something was going wrong I needed to use print statements. 
Print statements can be helpful, but in circumstances where your mistake almost emulates correct behavior,
it can sometimes be hard to see the pattern. If the behavior comes close enough to what you mean to 
accomplish but fails weirdly, it can make it very tough to suss out what's happening. This really drove
home how much I have to know about what's going on so I can better debug things without the aid of a debugger.
