# Various PSU CS Classwork

This repository displays some of the programming coursework completed while obtaining my CS degree at Portland State University. It holds projects that were too small for their own repo, but are good examples of C++, parallel programming, and more.
# Included

## CS 350 - Algorithms and Complexity (Jan 2022 - Mar 2022)

### Pebble Collecting Robot
This displays a tabular solution for a robot who collects 1's from a board covered in 1's and 0s. The robot can only move right and down. We want to know the largest number of 1's the robot can collect from the board with only this moveset. This solution was engineered from a recursive solution into a tabular solution to improve performance.
