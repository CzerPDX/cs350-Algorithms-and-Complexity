# CS 350 - Algorithms & Complexity

This repo is for displaying the code I'd like to share from my algorithms and complexity class taken at Portland State University between January 2022 and March 2022. This repo will mainly include C++ solutions.

# Included

## pebbleCollectingRobot
This displays a tabular solution for a robot who collects 1's from a board covered in 1's and 0s. The robot can only move right and down. We want to know the largest number of 1's the robot can collect from the board with only this moveset. This solution was engineered from a recursive solution into a tabular solution to improve performance.
