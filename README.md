# Various PSU CS Classwork
Author: Brooke Czerwinski

This repository displays some of the programming coursework I completed while obtaining my CS degree at Portland State University. It holds projects that were too small for their own repo, but are good examples of C++, parallel programming, and more.


# Work Included in This Repository

## CS 350 - Algorithms and Complexity (2022)

### Pebble Collecting Robot (C++)
This displays a tabular solution for a robot who collects 1's from a board covered in 1's and 0s. The robot can only move right and down. We want to know the largest number of 1's the robot can collect from the board with only this moveset. **This solution was engineered from a recursive solution into a tabular solution to improve performance.**

## CS 202 - Programming Systems (2020)

### Communication System (C++)
This software simulates a communication system, allowing users to manage contacts and their associated devices, including landlines, tablets, and smartphones. Users can send and receive simulated calls and text messages, and the application maintains communication logs for each device. **The program demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming techniques, focusing on inheritance and operator overloading, as well as the implementation of custom classes like a String class.**

### Weekly Calendar (C++)
This project keeps track of a user's calendar of tasks for the week. This software creates a calendar system that allows users to add, remove, and view daily items such as grocery lists, appointments, and schoolwork. **The application uses linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism, and provides input validation and error handling utilities.**
