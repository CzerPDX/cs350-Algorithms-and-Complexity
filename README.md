# CS 350 - Algorithms & Complexity

This repo is for displaying the code I'd like to share from my algorithms and complexity class taken at Portland State University between January 2022 and March 2022.

# Included
## pebbleCollectingRobot
This displays a tabular solution for a robot who collects 1's from a board covered in 1's and 0s. The robot can only move right and down. This solution was engineered from a recursive solution into a tabular solution to improve performance.
