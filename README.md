## pebbleCollectingRobot - CS350 Algorithms and Complexity (Jan 2022 - Mar 2022)
This displays a tabular solution for a robot who collects 1's from a board covered in 1's and 0s. The robot can only move right and down. We want to know the largest number of 1's the robot can collect from the board with only this moveset. This solution was engineered from a recursive solution into a tabular solution to improve performance.
